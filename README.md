Mocha CFW - The sweet chocolate to your latte! 
  
Mocha CFW is a custom firmware that is derived from iosuhax.  
It offers all the features of iosuhax and some addional features without the requirement of a fw.img on the SD card.  
Furthermore it combines all the current features of a custom firmware such as sysNAND or redNAND with signature  
patches into one application with a configuration setting.  
It also allows homebrew to access the entire filesystem.
